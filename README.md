# Calibration-Model-for-DIBS-and-Extrapolation-onto-German-Non-Domestic-Building-Stock
This repository holds the script used for the development of the DIBS energy calibration model and the extrapolation of the entire German non-domestic building stock. 

Only the R scripts are provided in this repository. The required input data is stored locally due to data protection requirements. Further, the resulting models are also only stored locally due to file size issues. Only the best-performing calibration models for space heating, occupancy hot water and electricity are available [via Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/wl3fg5m3auuj83taml0v2/AKGZ4fyrySrzL6JshOBFWZg?rlkey=tjjcbqplxgaucqaxbbnu0cxsd&dl=0).
