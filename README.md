# Calibration-Model-for-DIBS-and-Extrapolation-onto-German-Non-Domestic-Building-Stock
This repository holds the script used for the development of the DIBS energy calibration model and the extrapolation of the entire German non-domestic building stock. The best-performing calibration models for space heating, electricity and occupancy hot water are provided as well.

Only the R scripts and best-performing models are provided in this repository. The required input data is stored locally due to data protection requirements. The alternative models are also only stored locally due to file size issues.
